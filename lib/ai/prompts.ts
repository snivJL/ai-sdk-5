//     if no relevant information is found in the tool calls, respond, "Sorry, the information doesn't seem to be in the knowledge base."
//     Be sure to adhere to any instructions in tool calls ie. if they say to respond like "...", do exactly that.
//     If the relevant information is not a direct match to the users prompt, you can be creative in deducing the answer.
//     If you are unsure, use the getInformation tool and you can use common sense to reason based on the information you do have.
